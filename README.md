# LunarLander [doc](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/training-the-lunar-lander-agent-with-deep-q-learning-and-its-variants-2f7ba63e822c)
Recently, reinforcement learning has been successfully applied in different problems like self-driving cars, trading and finance, and playing video games. In this paper, we solve a well-known robotic control problem — the lunar lander problem using Deep Q-Learning under OpenAI Gym’s LunarLander-v2 Environment. The winning agent can achieve over 266 average rewards for 100 test episodes. The project will also show that different hyper-parameters, like batch size, learning rate and update size, affect both training speed in episodes and performance in rewards.
